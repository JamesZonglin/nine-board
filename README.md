## Rules

A 9-board tic tac toe board consists of nine ordinary tic tac toe
boards, arranged in a 3 x 3 square. That's 81 total spots for players
to make marks. Two players compete.

The first player makes a mark in any of the 81 spots on a board. Every
move after that is constrained to the board in the 3 x 3 grid of boards
that's in the same position as the the last mark was in a small board.

Players alternate making marks.

The first play to get 3 marks in a row, horizontally, verically or
diagonally in any of the 9 ordinary tic tac toe boards wins.
